#Given two non-empty arrays of integers(numbers), write a function that 
#determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
#A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily 
#adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in 
#the array. For instance, the numbers [1,3,4] form a subsequence of the 
#array [1,2,3,4], and so do the numbers [2,4]. Note that a single number 
#in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
#( [1],[2],[3],[4]and [1,2,3,4] are all valid subsequences of [1,2,3,4] )
#Sample Output
#array = [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
#subsequence = [1,6,-1,10]
#Answer: True
